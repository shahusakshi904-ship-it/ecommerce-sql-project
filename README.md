# E-Commerce SQL Project
This is my First SQL Project.
I Created three tables: Customers,Products,and Orders.
Then I added sample data and wrote simple SQL queries to Understand how a basic database Works.
## What I learned:
- How to Create tables in SQL
- How to Insert Data
- How to write basic SELECT queries
- How an e-commerce database is structured
  ### Files in this Project:
  -schema.sql (table creation)
  -sample_data.sql(sample records)
  -basic_queries.sql(simple SQL queries)
